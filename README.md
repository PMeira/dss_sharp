# dss_sharp

This will contain files for the C# bindings for dss_capi, an unofficial build with a custom C-API of EPRI's OpenDSS.

Currently, the source code is on the main `dss_capi` repository:

https://github.com/PMeira/dss_capi/tree/master/src/dss_sharp

This code will be refactored and benchmarked later, hence it's better to use a separate repository.
