# dss_sharp

This contain files for the C# bindings for dss_capi, an unofficial build with a custom C-API of EPRI's OpenDSS. With it, you can replace the COM module with very few code changes and reach multi-platform C# code easily!

Previously, the source code here was hosted in https://github.com/PMeira/dss_capi/ itself. 

This code will be refactored and benchmarked later, hence it's better to use a separate repository.
